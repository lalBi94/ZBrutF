## The ZBrute Force

ZBrutF, or "The ZBrute Force," is an online platform designed to assist you in searching for hash matches within a variety of wordlists for the most commonly used hashing algorithms. This platform allows you to compare hashes you provide with data extracted from these wordlists, covering MD5, SHA-1, SHA-3, SHA-256, SHA-512, and RIPMD-160 algorithms.

## How It Works

### Fetching Wordlists

1. **Fetching Wordlists Online**: Our platform begins by fetching one wordlist at a time from online sources. These wordlists contain a large number of words and their corresponding hashes for different hashing algorithms.

### Splitting Wordlists

2. **Splitting into Chunks**: Once a wordlist is downloaded, it is split into several "chunks" or smaller pieces. This step is crucial for facilitating hash match searches.

### Comparing Hashes

3. **Finding Matches**: ZBrutF examines each chunk individually to search for hash matches. Specifically, it checks if the hash provided by the user matches a hash of a line in the wordlist.

4. **Results**: If a match is found, ZBrutF will promptly inform you, providing access to information about the word that corresponds to the hash.

## Objective

The goal of ZBrutF is to help you determine whether a specific hash corresponds to a word or character sequence found in online wordlists. This platform can be valuable for security verification tasks, password decryption, or solving other hash matching challenges.

Please remember that the use of this platform should comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and it should only be used for lawful and ethical activities.
